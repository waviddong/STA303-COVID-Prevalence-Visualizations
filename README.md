# STA303-COVID-Prevalence-Visualizations

This was an assignment for one of my courses that took real time data in Toronto to map the prevalence of COVID-19 during the past year. In the attached report, you can read about the visualizations and findings that I made. From web-scraping our data from a government repository, this was then transformed in many ways to aggregate our data frame into a tidy dataframe which allowed us to easily map our observations of interest. Using string methods, dplyr packages, and visualization packages for GIS mapping, the PDF is the final result.
